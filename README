To do list for Att-R (Attractor Renderer) a GLFW3 OpenGL attractor rendering program.

Dependencies (install these before attempting to compile):
	GLAD - openGL library 
		installation links: https://glad.dav1d.de/

	glfw3 - graphics engine 
		installation links: https://www.glfw.org/ (or your package manager!!!)

	cglm - graphics maths, currently unused but will be used later for camera translations aswell as bloom
		installation links: https://github.com/recp/cglm (or once again, your package manager!!!) 
	

List of what to do and what I've completed thus far..

1. Run through the initial maths - DONE

2. Create the GLFW environment and initial program (to graph the maths I completed) - DONE

3. optimization and efficiency!! - STARTED
	3-1. translate all cpp scripts into c scripts, adopt cglm over glm - DONE
	3-2. fix the way tail colour values are sent to the shader
	3-3. aproximate sqrt, maybe even division (its chaotic anyways, at least see how it works out)

4. add more attractor equations other than lorenz (as many as I can!)

5. add optional camera rotation to accentuate the 3D aspect.

6. add bloom / blurring to hide the pixelation

7. create various makefiles for (32 and 64 bit?) Debian based linux systems, arch based linux systems, as well as windows. compile the program with these systems and add the precompiled binaries to download.
